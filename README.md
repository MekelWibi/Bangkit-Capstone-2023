Idea
Calories are an essential source of energy for our bodies. The food we consume provides us with calories which are processed and converted into energy to support our body's organs. If we consume fewer calories than our body requires, we may experience fatigue and weight loss. On the other hand, if we consume an excess of calories, our body stores the extra energy as weight gain. It can be challenging to determine the calorie count of the food and drinks we consume. Some individuals may want to gain weight by consuming more calories, while others may want to lose weight by consuming fewer calories. To address this issue, we want to develop a calorie prediction application. This application is designed to estimate the number of calories present in food by analyzing food images and displaying an estimate of the calories.

Our application is designed to detect food images and provide calorie information based on them. We believe that this application will be a helpful tool for individuals who want to manage their daily calorie intake. We will narrow down our scope by using fruits as our dataset. We want our application to detect fruit based on image and provide calorie information based on an image.
